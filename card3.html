      <h1>CITIC Dicastal Morocco... First "Lighthouse Factory" in Africa</h1>
      <p>
          CITIC Dicastal Morocco, a subsidiary of the Chinese group CITIC, has been officially designated as a "Lighthouse Factory" by the World Economic Forum, becoming the first factory in Africa to receive this prestigious recognition. Announced on January 14, 2025, this distinction highlights the factoryâ€™s excellence in Industry 4.0 technologies and digital transformation.
      </p>
      <p>
          Located in the Kenitra Atlantic Free Zone, the factory covers 26 hectares and includes three production units. It has an annual capacity of 6 million aluminum wheels and 5 million aluminum steering knuckles, making it the largest Chinese investment project in Morocco since the establishment of the strategic partnership between the two countries.
      </p>
      <p>
          CITIC Dicastal Morocco has integrated cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and the Internet of Things (IoT) across its entire production chain. These innovations have helped solve complex industrial challenges, such as controlling casting processes, managing production defects, and implementing intelligent mold maintenance. The results are impressive: a 17.35% increase in overall equipment efficiency, a 26.58% boost in productivity, and a 31.11% reduction in defect rates.
      </p>
      <p>
          In addition to its technological achievements, CITIC Dicastal Morocco is committed to sustainable development. By using AI and big data to optimize energy consumption, the factory has been certified "carbon neutral." It also collaborates with the Moroccan Institute for Standardization (IMANOR) to develop national Moroccan standards for green supply chains and zero-carbon factories.
      </p>
      <p>
          Mr. Badr Lahmoudi, President of CITIC Dicastal Morocco, expressed pride in this recognition: "This success is the result of exceptional collaboration between our Chinese team, our local team, and our ecological partners. Together, we have implemented advanced digital technologies that have optimized our processes, improved our productivity, and fostered a culture of continuous improvement."
